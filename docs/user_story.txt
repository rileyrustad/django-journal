As the journaler this is what I want:

Morning Entry:


At the beginning of the week I want to establish a few things:

Weekly goals:
- Beginning of week is user defined - for me it's Mondays
- Goals have categories that they fall in
- Goals are numbered by priority within category


- On start of the week days:
- evaluate on last weeks goals
- write down new weeks goals
- if "beginning day is skippped" user will be promted on next session for "Beginning info"
- if it's been more than one week skipped, give most recent goals, but start it for most immediate start of the week

- On non-start of the week days:
- I give myself a green, yellow, and red light on how I feel it's going

Upcoming events Countdown:
- Tells me how many days I have until that important date
- can create new ones on any day
- event model has text for name and a date field

Pre-defined 5 minture Questions:
- for now all charfields, since that's how my journal is now
    - look to having more options like checkboxes/radio buttons
- model for each 5 minute question? or different type?


Additional Reflection:
- Text field for extra journalling/reflection
